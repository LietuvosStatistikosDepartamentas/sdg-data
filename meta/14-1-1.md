  This, or part of this, indicator is awaiting the development of internationally established methodology and standards (classified by the UN as tier 3). This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to
  meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

**Summary**
* The indicator shows the combined input of six of the most hazardous substances to the UK marine environment; five heavy metals (cadmium, mercury, copper, lead and zinc) and one organic compound (lindane). 
* The combined inputs of all six hazardous materials into marine environments have
shown a long term decrease of 80% since 1990. 
* Inputs of five of these substances show decreases since 2011, however the input of copper has increased by 1% in the short term. 
* Pollution in the marine environment from these six substances should decrease to levels that are non-
detrimental by 2020.
